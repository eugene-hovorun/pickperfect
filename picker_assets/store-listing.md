PickPerfect — Color Picker for Developers

## Short Description (132 chars max)

Pick colors from any pixel. Copy as HEX, RGB, HSL instantly. Native EyeDropper API — zero bloat, zero DOM injection, zero tracking.

## Description

PickPerfect is a fast, lightweight color picker built for developers and designers who want one thing: pick a color and copy it — instantly.

Unlike other color picker extensions, PickPerfect uses the native EyeDropper API built into Chrome. This means:

→ Zero content scripts injected into your pages
→ Zero DOM modification — can't break React, Next.js, or any web app
→ No "cz-shortcut-listen" attributes, no SSR hydration errors
→ Minimal permissions — fully transparent about what we access

HOW IT WORKS

1. Click the extension icon or press Ctrl+Shift+C
2. Click any pixel on your screen
3. Color is copied to your clipboard — done

WHY PICKPERFECT?
If you've used other color pickers, you've probably experienced: broken clipboard, injected DOM elements breaking your app, ugly UI, or surprise ads. PickPerfect was built to fix all of that.

We believe trust is a feature:
• Transparent permissions (storage for history, activeTab/scripting for palette extraction)
• No tracking, no analytics, no ads
• No data collection of any kind
• Chrome Manifest V3 — latest security standards
• On-demand palette extraction only (never runs in background)

Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+C (customizable at chrome://extensions/shortcuts)
Requires Chrome 95+ (for EyeDropper API support)
