## Title

PickPerfect — Color Picker for Developers

## Short Description (132 chars max)

Pick colors from anywhere on your screen. Copy as HEX, RGB, HSL instantly. Native API — zero bloat, zero DOM injection, zero tracking.

## Description

PickPerfect is a fast, lightweight color picker built for developers and designers who want one thing: pick a color and copy it — instantly.

**PICK FROM ENTIRE SCREEN, NOT JUST BROWSER**
Unlike most color pickers that only work within the browser, PickPerfect uses Chrome's native EyeDropper API to pick colors from ANYWHERE on your screen — including other apps, desktop, images, videos, PDFs, everything.

**ZERO DOM INJECTION = ZERO PROBLEMS**
Other color picker extensions inject content scripts that:
→ Break React/Next.js SSR hydration
→ Add weird attributes like "cz-shortcut-listen" to your HTML
→ Slow down page loads
→ Break production builds

PickPerfect uses the native EyeDropper API built into Chrome. This means:
→ Zero content scripts injected into your pages
→ Zero DOM modification — can't break any web app
→ No interference with React, Vue, Angular, or any framework
→ Minimal permissions — fully transparent

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Click the extension icon or press Ctrl+Shift+C
2. Click any pixel anywhere on your screen
3. Color is copied to your clipboard — done

**FREE FEATURES**
• Pick any color from your entire screen (not just browser!)
• Copy as HEX, RGB, or HSL with one click
• Format preference saved across sessions
• Color history saves your last 20 picks (persisted)
• Right-click any saved color to remove it

**PREMIUM FEATURES ($2.99 one-time)**
• **WCAG Contrast Checker** — Compare two colors for accessibility compliance (AA/AAA ratings for large/normal text)
• **Tailwind Color Mapping** — Find the nearest Tailwind CSS color from 242 colors with match accuracy %
• **Page Palette Extraction** — Extract all colors from any webpage with smart grouping and type detection (background/text/border)

Perfect for design system analysis, accessibility audits, and Tailwind workflows.
