## Title
PickPerfect — Color Picker for Developers

## Short Description (132 chars max)
Pick colors from any pixel. Copy as HEX, RGB, HSL instantly. Native EyeDropper API — zero bloat, zero DOM injection, zero tracking.

## Description

PickPerfect is a fast, lightweight color picker built for developers and designers who want one thing: pick a color and copy it — instantly.

Unlike other color picker extensions, PickPerfect uses the native EyeDropper API built into Chrome. This means:

→ Zero content scripts injected into your pages
→ Zero DOM modification — can't break React, Next.js, or any web app
→ No "cz-shortcut-listen" attributes, no SSR hydration errors
→ Minimal permissions — only "storage" for your color history

HOW IT WORKS
1. Click the extension icon or press Ctrl+Shift+C
2. Click any pixel on your screen
3. Color is copied to your clipboard — done

FEATURES
• Pick any color from any pixel on your screen
• Copy as HEX, RGB, or HSL with one click
• Format preference is remembered across sessions
• Color history saves your last 20 picks
• Right-click any saved color to remove it
• Clean, modern popup — no clutter, no confusion

WHY PICKPERFECT?
If you've used other color pickers, you've probably experienced: broken clipboard, injected DOM elements breaking your app, ugly UI, or surprise ads. PickPerfect was built to fix all of that.

We believe trust is a feature:
• Only one permission: storage (for your color history)
• No tracking, no analytics, no ads
• No data collection of any kind
• Chrome Manifest V3 — latest security standards

Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+C (customizable at chrome://extensions/shortcuts)
Requires Chrome 95+ (for EyeDropper API support)
